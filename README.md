## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure
- **SCSS** — Modular and responsive styling
- **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** — For layout and alignment
- **Google Fonts** — Red Hat Display
- **Media Queries** — For responsiveness

## 📲 Responsive Design

The layout is fully responsive and adapts from large desktops to small mobile screens using:

- CSS Grid for structured elements
- Flexbox for alignment and spacing
- `clamp()` for fluid typography and element sizing
- Media queries for layout adjustments at breakpoints (e.g. 768px, 480px)

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:

- Advanced use of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** together
- Structuring a page using semantic HTML and modular SCSS
- Creating **layered backgrounds** with `::before` and `::after` in the footer

## 🧠 Continued Development

Some future ideas or improvements:

- Add animations on scroll using JavaScript or CSS
- Convert the project into a React component-based version
- Add a dark mode toggle 🌙
